#POMDP #Textbook 

"The MDP framework is able to model stochastic environments, but it assumes that the agent is totally aware of the status of the environment itself (i.e. that the environment is fully observable). For example, it could not model a situation with hidden information, such as an opponentâ€™s cards in poker or the current severity of a disease with a patient. ... An environment which is partially observable means that the agent does not have direct access to its own state, but must infer the situation based on the (possibly noisy) observations it receives."

"Point-based POMDP planning algorithms create approximate POMDP solutions by only considering a finite subset of points in belief space."
