Notes:
 - Very impressive performance. Indicates significant performance boost of RL + model learning.
 - In external video, robot doesn't really "walk" in a conventional way. However, it does have positive controlled velocity.
 - If this trained in 1 hour (What compute resources? Time is somewhat meaningless unless we assume some upper bound on resources available to UC Berkeley students), why haven't follow-on papers made enormous progress? Is it the desire for expert imitation.
